# ML Validation Calculation API + service
This repo contains the API which exposes the ML validation calculation to our network, along with the `systemd` service unit to manage the API.

There is one endpoint, `/mlval`, and documentation can be found at `http://192.168.1.XX:7114/apidocs` (replace `XX` with last two digits of `Sandra`'s IP)
